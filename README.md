# RDMA in Go

I just learnt Go,
and I think Goroutine should be a very nice tool to write RDMA-based systems.
Hence I tried to build a simple Go wrapper layer on top of ibverbs,
so that we could interact with RDMA NIC in Go.


Since I just learnt Go, I'm still learning the best practices for Go.
So bear with me on any pitfalls.
